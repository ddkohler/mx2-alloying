  - MoS2: show splitting distributions
    - double-check labeling: for monolayer, the two modes are:  E_1^\prime ~383 , A^\prime ~405
  - Similar figure for WS2?  tough, because resonance effect is convolved...
- Discussion: note that WS2 peak shifts may be due to inhomogeneity near the junction
- Raise the question of why our peaks are so different in energy from literature.
- [ ] reflection, fluorescence measurements of Yuzhou's WS2 monolayers
