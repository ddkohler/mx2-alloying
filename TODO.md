- [ ] Cite WrightTools, python ecosystem in paper for the data processing
- [ ] Revise RC manuscript image
  - full page width
  - include RC simulations (for each figure, put shift values in the figure as text box)
  - show twinning line in optical image?
  - 
- [ ] Revise Raman manuscript image
  - show splitting distributions
  - double-check labeling: for monolayer, the two modes are:  E_1^\prime ~383 , A^\prime ~405
- Discussion: note that WS2 peak shifts may be due to inhomogeneity near the junction
- Raise the question of why our peaks are so different in energy
